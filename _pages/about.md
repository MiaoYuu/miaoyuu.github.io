I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems at the Faculty of Business and Economics (IIM), The University of Hong Kong. My advisor is [Prof. Hailiang Chen](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/hailiang-chen/). 

My research interests involve (a) examining how algorithms influence human behavior and societal outcomes using econometrics, and (b) developing algorithms to address practical challenges in domains such as public sector services and fraud detection in Fintech, with a particular focus on trustworthy, explainable, and domain-adapted AI. To learn more about my work, please see my [CV](/cv/), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miao-y-86a492118/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Psa2zHcAAAAJ), or [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=4796013).
