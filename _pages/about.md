<div style="max-width:820px; margin:auto; margin-top:20px;">

  <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
  
  <p>
    I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems at the Faculty of Business and Economics (IIM), The University of Hong Kong. My advisor is <a href="https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/hailiang-chen/" target="_blank">Prof. Hailiang Chen</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My research investigates the impact of algorithms and aims to design algorithmic systems that improve social outcomes in real-world business contexts. I use a range of empirical and behavioral methods, including econometrics, field experiments, applied machine learning, and natural language processing.
